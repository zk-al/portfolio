# Welcome to my portfolio! 

## My name is Zack Lamarche and I am a Designer turned Developer.

Coming from a design role at a cannabis startup I wore many hats, learned integral skills on the fly, and had to come up with creative solutions under strict rules. My background in the service industry allows me to foster healthy collaborative environments even under intense pressure. Transitioning to web development allows me to engage both my creative and technical sides, refining my skills to contribute to projects with meaningful social and environmental impacts.
